-x <subnet>, --exclude=<subnet>
Explicitly exclude this subnet from forwarding. 
The format of this option is the same as the <subnets> option. 
To exclude more than one subnet, specify the -x option more than once. 
You can say something like 0/0 -x 1.2.3.0/24 to forward everything except the local subnet over the VPN, for example.

-X <file>, --exclude-from=<file>
Exclude the subnets specified in a file, one subnet per line. Useful when you have lots of subnets to exclude.
