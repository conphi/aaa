"Gran turned on to / onto a bridge." vs. "Gran turned to a bridge":

Gran turned onto a bridge. (奶奶开车上了桥。): This sentence indicates that Gran physically directed her vehicle onto a bridge, implying a change in direction towards and then onto the bridge's structure.

Gran turned to a bridge. (奶奶转向一座桥。): This sentence is less clear in modern English usage and might suggest a physical turning or transformation into a bridge, which is nonsensical in a literal sense. More contextually, it might be intended to mean "Gran turned towards a bridge," indicating a change in direction towards a bridge but not necessarily onto it. However, without the preposition "onto," the intended action of moving onto the bridge's surface is not clearly conveyed.

The key difference lies in the preposition used: "onto" clearly indicates movement to the top of something, while "to" suggests direction towards something without the implication of ending up on top of it.

This sentence simply states that the car ended up in the river due to a crash, without specifically indicating whether the car fell from a height. It focuses on the fact of the crash and the car's final location rather than the direction of movement.
The main difference lies in the emphasis on the direction of the movement: "crashed down into" suggests a specific downward action, while "crashed into" broadly denotes the crash without emphasizing the direction.

I told you so. (我早就告诉过你了。)

This phrase is used to emphasize that the speaker had previously warned or informed the listener about a specific outcome or situation that has now come to pass. It often carries a tone of vindication or a mild reprimand for not heeding the advice or warning.
I told you. (我告诉过你。)

This statement simply asserts that the speaker had communicated something to the listener in the past, without the added implication of the listener having ignored advice or warnings. It lacks the "I was right" implication of "I told you so" and is more neutral.
The main difference lies in the tone and the implied context: "I told you so" is more about being right and having previously warned someone, while "I told you" is a neutral statement of having said something in the past.
